# In this code:

 - For summing an array of numbers, the reduce method is used with an initial value of 0 and an accumulator function that adds each value to the accumulator.
 - For totaling a specific object property (yrsExperience), the reduce method is used similarly but accessing the property of each object.
 - For grouping by a property (profession) and totaling it, the reduce method is applied with an initial empty object {}, and the accumulator function checks and updates the 
   accumulator object accordingly.
